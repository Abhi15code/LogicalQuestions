 java parallel streams is a feature of java 8 , it means for utilizing multiple cores of the processor

 Normally any java code has one stream of processing, where it is executed sequentially. Whereas by using parallel streams,
  we can divide the code into multiple 
  streams that area executed in parallel on separate
 cores and the final result is the combination of the individual outcomes
  
  The order of execution, however, is not under our control.

  // it give the better performance
  // it execute in random order
